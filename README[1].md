# Space Runner (Pygame)

A compact arcade-style game built with Pygame. Control a spaceship to dodge falling meteors.
This repository contains:
- `main.py` : game entry point
- `assets/` : optional image files (project works without external assets)
- `README.md`
- `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`
- `SCREENSHOTS.md`
- `QA_CHECKLIST.md`

## How to run
1. Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Notes for submission
- The game generates simple assets at runtime, so no external image files are required.
- To create polished screenshots or a demo video, run the game in a windowed mode (600x700).
- The project is original and designed for demonstration of QA, testing, and basic AI-awareness (documented in QA checklist).
