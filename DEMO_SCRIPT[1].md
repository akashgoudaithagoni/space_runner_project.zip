     - Player movement (keyboard: ← → or A/D)
     - Collision detection and game over
     - Dynamic difficulty scaling
     - Runtime-generated assets (ensures portability)

4. QA notes overlay (6–8s)
   - Quick bullets showing what you tested:
     - Input latency tests (keystrokes vs movement)
     - Collision edge-case checks
     - Performance profiling at 60 FPS
     - Automated smoke test steps

5. Ending card (2–3s)

- Narrate briefly or add captions describing what you’re doing.
- Record the terminal showing `python main.py` and gameplay window for authenticity.
